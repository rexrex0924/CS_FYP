q2,0,mistral-small3.1:latest,C,C,A,1,"To determine the correct answer, we need to calculate the 8-bit one's complement and 8-bit two's complement of the binary number `10110`.  First, let's pad `10110` to an 8-bit number by adding leading zeros: `00010110`.  ### One's Complement The one's complement of a binary number is obtained by inverting all the bits (changing 0s to 1s and 1s to 0s).  For `00010110`: - Invert each bit: `11101001`  ### Two's Complement The two's complement of a binary number is obtained by inverting all the bits (one's complement) and then adding 1 to the least significant bit.  For `00010110`: - One's complement: `11101001` - Add 1 to the least significant bit: `11101001 + 1 = 11101010`  Now, we compare these results with the given options: - One's complement: `11101001` - Two's complement: `11101010`  The correct answer is: C. 11101001 11101010",What are the 8-bit one's complement and 8-bit two's complement of the binary number 10110 ?,01001111 01010000,00001001 00001010,11101001 11101010,11110110 11110111
